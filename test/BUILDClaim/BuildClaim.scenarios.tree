  // Bulloak generated scenarios to ensure user interaction coverage
  // user patterns are defined with:
  // n - no user interaction at all
  // R<user> - regular claim
  // E<user> - early claim
  // s<number> - season
  // and follow the format when time = (if present, add season)_(unlock 0%)_(unlock 50%)_(unlock 100%)_(if present, post refund)
  // users can be: 1, 2, M (msig)
  // example:
  // user 1 regular claim at unlock0, unlock100
  // user 2 regular claim at unlock0, early claims at unlock50
  // scenario: s1_R1R2_E2_R1
